# About

Main focus, using a DataGridView for working with data by setting the DataSource property of the DataGridView using a sortable BindingList along with a BindingSource.

This is better than accessing cells in the DataGridView as with setting the DataSource everything is strongly typed.

Without the SortableBindingList the DataGridView will not be able to sort by clicking column headers
