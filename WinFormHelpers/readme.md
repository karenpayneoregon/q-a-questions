# About

Uses extension methods to perform BindingSource filtering on a DataTable. Two methods are demonstrated, starts with and ends with case insensitive. 

Type in a search in either one for filtering, empty the current TextBox to remove the filter. For a real application there would be one TextBox with a ComboBox for options, starts with ends with and contains rather than two TextBox controls. 

Data is load from a database table but do not be concerned with this if not using a database as at the point the DataTable is used in the form the DataTable has no knowledge of the database.
